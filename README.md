# 🎡 Scientific Calculator in C

This is my first project as a computer science student, where I implemented a **scientific calculator** using the C programming language. The calculator supports various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- ✅ Trigonometric functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent
- ✅ Exponentiation and logarithmic functions
- ✅ Square root and factorial calculations
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs

## 💂 Repository Structure
```
├── README.md         # Project documentation
├── code.txt          # Source code for the calculator
├── power point.pptx  # Presentation about the project
```

## 🛠 Installation & Compilation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Narayanan1411/scientific-calculator-in-c.git
   cd scientific-calculator-in-c
   ```
2. Compile the C program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o calculator code.txt -lm
   ```
   *Note:* The `-lm` flag links the math library.

3. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
- Enter a valid mathematical operation when prompted.
- Follow on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
- Input "exit" to terminate the program.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Implement complex number operations.
- Enhance error handling and input validation.
